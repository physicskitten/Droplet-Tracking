# Tracking Droplet Motion Techniques for Quantum Hydrodynamic System
This code details the use of background subtraction, morphological operations, and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, enhancing the accuracy of tracking multiple droplets and providing a robust framework for analysing their dynamics. Contributing to the understanding of quantum-like behaviour in classical systems and offers a practical approach to MOT in complex scenarios. 

Theoretical concepts and deeper explanations accessible in complimenting written documentation. Each code file has its own readme file with the same filename for ease of use. Repository is forked from TJ-coding and folder name with respective name contains his code however documentation and readme files on said code was created by physicskitten and is my own interpretation of his work.
